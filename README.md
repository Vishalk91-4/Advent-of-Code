# Advent of Code '23

This repository contains my solutions to `Advent of Code 2023`[^aoc] so that the elves can deliver your Christmas gifts on time. Since Santa really doesn't care about what nerdy langauge I commit to, I plan on trying to be a polygot this year, and would try to solve the problems in multiple ways, as and when I get the time.

Happy holidays!

[^aoc]:
    [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) – An annual event of Christmas-oriented programming challenges started December 2015.
    Every year since then, beginning on the first day of December, a programming puzzle is published every day for twenty-four days.
    You can solve the puzzle and provide an answer using the language of your choice.
